    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Zoho to QuickBooks Online Migration Tool ("we", "our", or "the Tool") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our invoice migration service.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use our Tool, we access the following information solely for the purpose of migrating your invoices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Invoice data from your Zoho Books account (invoice numbers, dates, amounts, line items)</li>
        <li>Customer names associated with invoices</li>
        <li>QuickBooks Online company information necessary to create invoices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your data is used exclusively to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read invoices from your Zoho Books account</li>
        <li>Transform invoice data to QuickBooks Online format</li>
        <li>Create corresponding invoices in your QuickBooks Online account</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not permanently store your invoice data. All data processing occurs in real-time during the migration process. OAuth tokens are stored locally on your machine and can be deleted after migration is complete.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your information with third parties. Your data is only transmitted between Zoho Books, QuickBooks Online, and your local machine during the migration process.</p>
